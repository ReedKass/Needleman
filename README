Assignment: HW1 - Part 2
Description: This program uses the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm to score
             a given set of two sequences based on a rubric set in the
             main. The program uses a two-dimsional vector as the primary
             data structure. 

This is my complete MakeFile:

I used this code to compile my program via a makefile. It is coded in C++.
===================================================
CXX      = clang++
CXXFLAGS = -std=c++11 -g3 -Wall -Wextra
LDFLAGS  = -g3
all: align

align: align.o 
	${CXX} ${LDFLAGS} -o align main.o 

align.o:	align.cpp  

clean:
	rm -rf hw4 *.o *.dSYM
===================================================



===================================================
Changing the scoring scheme: 

You can change the scoring scheme easily by changing the values in 'main'
for the struct rubric.
===================================================

All source code is located in 'align.cpp' 

I used the cpp vector structure, ensure that is availible if you are 
going to try to re-compile the code.

I did all of my work on the cs.tufts environment.
